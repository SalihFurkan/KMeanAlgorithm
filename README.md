# K_Means Algorithm
Implementation of K Means algorithm. Only works for two dimensional vectors (x,y). It is produced to demonstrate how K Means Algorithm works.
# Training
The points and clusters are plotted in the training. You need to initialize how many cluster and epochs you want. (Elbow method will be added)
# Prediction
When you give the vector to predict which cluster it will belong, it return the point of the cluster.
